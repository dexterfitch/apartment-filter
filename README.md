# Apartment Filter

### Make Choosing an Apartment Suck a Tiny Bit Less

------

#### A web application that helps people save apartments they've found and then organize them with custom filters.
There's over half a dozen apps and sites to search for apartments, not to mention local and digital classifieds, and leasing sites themselves. Each of these search avenues come with their own peccadillos, their own favourites lists and filters, that aren't exportable, or even consistent with other sites, not to mention the discrepencies between different lists for available apartment vacancies. This can make getting organized, accurate, accessible information difficult. Thus, the goals of Apartment Filter are to:
1. Be an accessible way to save your favourite apartments while shopping around.
2. Be able to create and save as many favourite lists as you like.
3. Be able to create as many feature tags as you like.
4. Be able to organize your lists by feature tags.
