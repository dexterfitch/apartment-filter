# Apartment Filter

### Make Choosing an Apartment Suck a Tiny Bit Less
------
#### A web application that helps people save apartments they've found and then organize them with filters.
There's like over half a dozen apps and sites to search for apartments, not to mention local and digital classifieds, and leasing sites themselves. Each of these avenues come with their own peccadillos, their own favourites lists and filters that aren't exportable or even consistent with other sites, not to mention the discrepencies between lists for apartment vacancies. This can make getting organized, accurate, accessible information difficult! Thus, the goals of Apartment Filter are to:
1. Be an accessible and user-friendly way to save your favourite apartments while shopping around.
2. Be able to save as many favourite lists as you like, and organize them however you like.
3. Be able to filter your lists by whatever features you want.
